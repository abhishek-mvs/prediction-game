I want to create a new smart contract in movementlabs
1. This contract will be prediction game
2. Admin: can create a poll (Game), on which team will win today -> This will return the id of the game. 
This will have 
a. Title of the game, time of the contest that going to end. And also time for accepting the predictions. And entry price for that game. 
b. Number of teams, with each have names and id
c. The number of polls for the each game and users address who predicted that team
 
3. Now users can connect with the wallet, can check the games that are active at the present time. 
4. Users can predict the game, by paying the entry price. 
5. After the game ends, the admin will declare the winner team, and the users who predicted that team will get the money from the pool. The admin will get 1% cut from the pool. 
6. The users can check the leaderboard of the prediction game. 
7. The users can check the history of the prediction game. And all the previous games details. 
8. User can also check his active predictions and previous predictions.
